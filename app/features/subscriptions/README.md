references:
this app uses managed pricing:
https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/managed-pricing

that means this does not fully make sense in the docs:
https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix/v2/apis/billing?example=require-requesting-billing-right-away

instead I just redirect to the hosted url:
appUrl.pricingPlans

its super easy just the docs are not update for that case.
